## This project is devoted to solving a task based on Kaggle data(https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data/data#loan.csv). Overview of my solution can be found in Summary notebook.

## Task description is as follows:

1. Prepare predictive model(s) of default. Default client is defined as one with loan_status variable taking on the following levels:
..*Charged off
..*Default
..*Does not meet the credit policy. Status: Charged Off
..*Late (31-120 days)
 
2. Present a few competing predictive models and select one of them. Explain criteria for the selection.          

3. Provide necessarily ROC graphs and AUC for comparison purposes.

4. Optionally, calculate performance metrics you find important in this specific context (metrics should be based on testing set, which should consist 30% randomly selected clients from the original dataset)

5. If necessary, make appropriate data pre-processing.
